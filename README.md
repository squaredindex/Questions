# Questions
 **Questionsâ„¢** is a simple "game" intended to break the ice or get to know someone better, perhaps you need some little conversation starters or fun prompts for date for instance.

 The questions are sourced from various places, some made up by myself or suggested by friends.
 A great many are from the wonderful prompt cards made by [School of Life](https://www.theschooloflife.com/).

 Please feel free to suggest new question and categories. All of the questions are currently in `public/questions.json` -- if it gets much larger, then I will probably break it up by category.


## To-do
- [ ] Create custom icons for categories
- [ ] Add icons as icon components and display for the relevant categories
- [ ] Add nicer animations to game ending
- [ ] Add settings menu
- [ ] Allow the user to choose categories -- *should update questions reactively*
- [ ] Allow the user to choose difficulty -- *should update questions reactively*
- [ ] Add the remaining 69 of 100 base questions (*not a joke, that's the real number*)
- [ ] Curate the difficulty of these questions and update tags accordingly
- [ ] Add [autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer) to ensure better browser compatibility
- [ ] 

## Additional content
- [ ] Add dating specific questions category
- [ ] Add couples questions category

In the future it might be interesting to move this over to [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and make it more of a real-time multiplayer experience, however, right now it's mainly something you can use in person as an alternative to having the sort of physical prompt cards School of Life does.
